            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Numbers have always told me stories. From my early days tinkering with electronics to now, when I wrangle vast datasets, I've been captivated by the tales hidden in data. My journey has taken me from the bustling halls of Amazon, where I helped Alexa become a bit wiser, to the frontier of AI development, where I'm training large language models to write better code than I can (well, almost).</p>
<p>Armed with a shiny Master's in Data Science and a toolbox full of Python, R, and SQL, I'm on a mission to turn data into gold. Whether I'm crafting sleek Tableau dashboards that make executives say 'wow!', or diving deep into machine learning models that predict the future (no crystal ball needed), I'm always chasing that next big insight. </p>
                

<p>But it's not all algorithms and spreadsheets. I believe in the power of storytelling with data. Give me a messy dataset, and I'll give you back a narrative that you would find fascinating. When I'm not crunching numbers, you might find me dreaming up new ways to visualize the invisible patterns that shape our world.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking for someone who can turn your data chaos into data clarity, with a side of wit and a dash of creativity, you've come to the right place. Let's embark on a data adventure together!.</p>
