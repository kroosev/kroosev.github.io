                <h3>Project 1: Stock Market Portfolio Optimization</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on optimizing a stock market portfolio to maximize returns while minimizing risk. By analyzing historical stock performance data from prominent Indian companies (HDFCBANK, INFY, RELIANCE, TCS) and applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the project constructs an efficient portfolio. The analysis includes examining price trends, computing moving averages, assessing daily returns, and evaluating stock correlations to achieve diversification. The final portfolio aims to balance risk and return by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, providing a strategic allocation of assets for long-term investment goals. </p>

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>
<ul>                
<li> Python: For data analysis and optimization </li>
<li> Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis </li>
<li> NumPy: Numerical computations </li>
<li> Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization </li>
<li> yfinance API: Real-time stock market data collection </li>
<li> Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): Portfolio optimization </li>
</ul>
<h4> Key Findings: </h4>
<ul>
<li> TCS and RELIANCE demonstrated strong upward trends in stock prices, making them key contributors to the portfolio's performance. </li>
<li> INFY and RELIANCE exhibited higher volatility, suggesting more significant potential returns but with increased risk. </li>
<li> The correlation analysis highlighted diversification opportunities, with lower correlations between certain stocks, reducing overall portfolio risk. </li>
<li> The optimal portfolio, maximizing the Sharpe ratio, allocated 40.53% to TCS, reflecting its significant impact on performance, and balanced other assets to enhance risk-adjusted returns. </li>
<li> The final portfolio achieved an expected return of approximately 26.08% with a volatility of 15.54%, indicating an efficient balance between risk and return. </li>

                <h3>Project 2: Health-Monitoring-and-Analysis-using-Python</h3>
                <p> This project involves the systematic analysis of health data to monitor and evaluate the health status of individuals. Using a dataset containing various health metrics (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) from 500 individuals, the project aims to provide insights into patient health through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and grouping based on key health indicators. The analysis helps to identify natural groupings within the data, enabling more personalized health monitoring and management strategies.</p>

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>
<ul> 
<li> Python: For data analysis and visualization </li>
<li> Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing </li>
<li> Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization</li>
<li> SciPy: Statistical analysis</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Gender Distribution and Correlation Analysis: The dataset has an almost even split between male and female participants, with no strong correlations observed between the various health metrics, suggesting that these metrics are largely independent of one another in this population. </li>
<li> Heart Rate and Activity Levels: The analysis revealed that heart rate increases with activity level, though there is unexpected variability between walking and running, indicating potential individual differences in physiological responses.</li>
<li> Blood Pressure Insights: The distribution of blood pressure levels showed typical patterns, with most individuals falling within normal ranges, though a smaller subset exhibited elevated or hypertensive readings.</li>
<li> Health Metrics by Gender: There were no significant differences in heart rate or oxygen saturation between genders, with both showing similar distributions.</li>
<li> Sleep Quality and Stress Levels: Heart rate and oxygen saturation remained relatively consistent across different levels of sleep quality and stress, with only minor variations observed.</li>
<li> Grouping and Categorization: Patients were grouped based on age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation categories, revealing that most participants fall within normal ranges for these health indicators.</li>
<li> Conclusion: The project highlights the importance of personalized health monitoring by categorizing patients based on their unique health metrics. The analysis provides a foundation for targeted health interventions and underscores the potential for more nuanced health assessments beyond traditional threshold-based systems.</li>

                <h3>Project 3: Quantitative Analysis of Stock Market using Python</h3>
                <p>This project involves the quantitative analysis of stock market data from four major companies (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, NFLX) to understand trends, volatility, correlations, and overall performance. By applying statistical and time series analysis, the project aims to provide insights into stock price movements, volatility, and risk versus return profiles, helping to inform investment decisions.</p>

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>
<ul> 
<li> Python: For data analysis and visualization </li>
<li> Pandas: Data manipulation and statistical calculations </li>
<li> Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization</li>
<li> NumPy: Numerical Computation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive Statistics: NFLX exhibited the highest mean closing price and the greatest price variability, while GOOG showed the least volatility.</li>
<li>Time Series Analysis: AAPL and MSFT displayed consistent upward trends, with NFLX showing the most significant price fluctuations.</li>
<li>Volatility Analysis: NFLX and MSFT had the highest volatility, making them more prone to price swings compared to AAPL and GOOG.</li>
<li>Correlation Analysis: AAPL and MSFT had a relatively higher positive correlation, indicating their prices often move in the same direction.</li>
<li>Comparative Performance: MSFT saw the highest positive price change (~16.10%), while NFLX experienced a significant decline (~-11.07%).</li>
<li>Risk vs. Return: AAPL offered the most stable returns with the lowest risk, whereas NFLX presented the highest risk with negative returns, indicating a volatile and less rewarding investment during the period.</li>

  <p>This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning models. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes several health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The models are trained and evaluated to determine which one best predicts the presence of heart disease.</p>
  <h4>Tools Used:</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li> Python: For data analysis and machine learning </li>
    <li> Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis </li>
    <li> Matplotlib: Data visualization</li>
    <li> Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, etc.) </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Performance: The KNN model with 12 neighbors achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 84.48%, making it the best-performing model in this study.</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier: The Random Forest model achieved a slightly lower accuracy of approximately 80.18%, indicating it is also a strong model but slightly less effective in this case.</li>
    <li>Overall Prediction Accuracy: The analysis indicates that machine learning models, especially KNN, can be effectively used to predict heart disease, offering a potential tool for early diagnosis and prevention.</li>
